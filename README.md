#### Model Overview

The Netflix Movie Recommendation Model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and analyze the content of movie titles, descriptions, and associated metadata. By inputting keywords, users can retrieve movies that align closely with their interests and preferences. The dataset includes more than 8800 movies on Netflix along with their details.

#### How It Works

The model operates by first preprocessing the extensive movie dataset, which includes normalizing text, removing stop words, and employing techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for significant feature extraction. These features are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that calculates similarity scores based on the userâ€™s keywords, effectively ranking movies by relevance.
